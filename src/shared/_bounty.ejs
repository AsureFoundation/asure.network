                        Asure Network is a layer 2 scaling network that enables fast, easy and secure transactions for
                        not only payment transactions, but also generalized smart contracts. Founded by German insurance
                        and technology experts, the network enables everyone to quickly build, operate, and use highly
                        scalable business applications through innovations in multi-chain scaling techniques and
                        incentive-aligned crypto economics mechanisms.

                        <strong>What Problems Does Asure Network Solve?</strong><br/>
                        We are developing Asure Network as an infrastructure for social security systems of the future.
                        Our goal is to provide access to 4.1 billion people worldwide who have no access to social
                        security systems today. The existing social security systems are based on centralized databases,
                        intransparent processes, fraud, corruption, labor-intensive processes and lack of trust in
                        systems are the challenges we solve with the help of blockchain and thus we create a global
                        inclusion in the social security market, just as Bitcoin allows for inclusion in the financial
                        market.
